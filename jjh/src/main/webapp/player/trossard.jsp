			Whether starting out wide, up front or influencing games from the bench, Belgian maestro Leandro <br>
			enjoyed a stellar season from the moment he scored the equaliser that paved the way for the <br>
			penalty shootout victory over Manchester City in the Community Shield in August 2023. <br>
			<br>
			He scored 17 goals in all competitions - with 12 of those coming in the league - and his winner at <br>
			Everton won the Premier League Goal of the Month award for September. <br>
			<br>
			The skilful winger added a new dimension to Arsenalâ€™s front line when he joined from Brighton & Hove <br>
			Albion in January 2023, and within weeks he became the first player in Premier League history to assist <br>
			three goals in the first half of an away game in a 3-0 win at Fulham. <br>
			<br>
			The versatile forward finished the campaign with ten assists in just 20 Premier League appearances, <br>
			having already made a big impact on the south coast when he became the first Brighton player to score <br>
			a Premier League hat-trick in their 3-3 draw at Liverpool. <br>
			<br>
			Leandro moved to England after winning the Belgian title with Genk in 2018/19 and, having made his <br>
			international debut in 2020, he featured at the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024.<br>
