			Experienced Scotland international Kieran is back at the club for 2024/25, having spent a <br>
			successful season at Real Sociedad, helping them finish sixth in La Liga (earning a place in <br>
			this season’s Europa League), the Copa del Rey semi-finals and Champions League round of 16. <br>
			<br>
			Before that the tough-tackling left back made 36 appearances for us in 2022/23, scoring once, <br>
			having been a regular starter the previous season until sustaining a knee injury in March 2022. <br>
			<br>
			A leader on and off the pitch, Kieran joined the Gunners in August 2019 from boyhood club Celtic, <br>
			where he lifted eight major trophies and won three successive PFA Scotland Young Player of the <br>
			Year awards, in 2016, 2017 and 2018 – winning the PFA Goal of the Season award in 2018 as well. <br>
			<br>
			He went on to lift the FA Cup in his first season in north London, followed by the Community <br>
			Shield in August 2020. <br>
			<br>
			A senior Scotland international since 2016, he netted his first goal for his country in March <br>
			2022 against Poland having featured twice at the delayed 2020 European Championships the previous <br>
			June, including on the left of a back three in the Scots’ 0-0 draw with England at Wembley. <br>
			<br>
			He started Scotland’s first two games at Euro 2024 but was injured in the second and missed their <br>
			final game.
