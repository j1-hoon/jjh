			He made 36 appearances in all competitions, scoring his first goal for the club – from the penalty <br>
			spot - in the 6-0 win over RC Lens in the Champions League. A natural leader with bags of experience, <br>
			he also captained the side six times. <br>

			The Brazilian-born Italy international joined from Chelsea in January 2023, and made an impact on <br>
			only his second start when his stoppage-time shot deflected in off Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano <br>
			Martinez to help us to a 4-2 win. <br>

			Jorginho – full name Jorge Luiz Frello Filho – started his career at Hellas Verona but rose to prominence <br>
			as a deep-lying playmaker at Napoli. He won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa before joining Chelsea in 2018, <br>
			winning the Europa League, Champions League, European Super Cup and World Club Cup over the following three <br>
			years. <br>
			<br>
			Having opted to play for his adopted country, he was a key figure as the Azzurri won the European Championships <br>
			at Wembley in 2021, playing the full 120 minutes before Italy’s penalty shootout victory over England. He <br>
			finished third in the Ballon d'Or voting that year. He featured again at Euro 2024.<br>
