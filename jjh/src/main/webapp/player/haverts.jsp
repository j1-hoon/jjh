			Versatile forward Kai enjoyed a fantastic first season in red and white, getting stronger as the <br>
			campaign progressed to finish with his best numbers to date: 20 goal involvements in the Premier <br>
			League, with 13 goals and seven assists, plus one goal in Europe. <br>
			<br>
			Having initially featured in an advanced midfield role after arriving in the summer, the Germany <br>
			international moved up front in the second half of the season and blossomed as a striker, with eight <br>
			of his goals coming in his final 14 appearances of the season. <br>
			<br>
			One of only two squad members, along with Bukayo Saka, to win Arsenal’s Player of the Month award <br>
			twice in 2023/24 (in November 2023 and April 2024), Kai joined us in June 2023 after a stint at <br>
			Chelsea in which he scored the winner in both the 2021 Champions League final against Manchester City <br>
			and FIFA Club World Cup final against Palmeiras in 2022. <br>
			<br>
			Kai had played all his senior football for Bayer Leverkusen before coming to the Premier League – <br>
			winning three Bundesliga Player of the Month awards, being named in the Team of the Season for 2018/19 <br>
			and reaching the German Cup the following season. <br>
			<br>
			He scored 46 times from 150 appearances for Leverkusen, and made his senior international debut aged 19 <br>
			in 2018. He scored at Euro 2020, the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024.<br>
