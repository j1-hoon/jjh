			Spain international midfielder Mikel joined at the start of the season following a stellar campaign for <br>
			both club and country, culminating in winning the European Championships with his national team in Germany.<br> 
			<br>
			The powerful, athletic midfielder was also an integral part of the Real Sociedad side, and in fact he won <br>
			more duels (326) than any other player in Europe’s big five leagues during 2023/24. <br>
			<br>
			Able to operate in a variety of midfield roles, Mikel is comfortable with the ball at his feet in tight <br>
			spaces, while also posing a considerable aerial threat. <br>
			<br>
			He started his career at Osasuna – where his father had also played – in the Segunda Division before joining <br>
			Borussia Dortmund and winning the German Cup under Thomas Tuchel in 2016/17. <br>
			<br>
			He spent the following campaign at Newcastle United, initially on loan, and made 25 appearances for the Magpies, <br>
			scoring one goal – a headed winner against Crystal Palace at St. James’ Park in October 2017 – before joining <br>
			Sociedad in the summer of 2018. He was named Player of the Match as the Basque club won the Copa del Rey in 2020 <br>
			and made 242 appearances in total, scoring 27 goals. <br>
			<br>
			A full international since 2020, Mikel was a standout performer at Euro 2024, featuring in every game for Spain <br>
			and scoring the 119th-minute winner–a header from Dani Olmo’s cross – against Germany in the quarter-final.<br>
