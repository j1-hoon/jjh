			Powerful midfielder Thomas showed his value to the team once again at the end of last season, <br>
			playing regularly during the run in and dominating opponents with his tough tackling, authority on <br>
			the ball and passing range. He began the campaign playing at right back, lifting the Community <br>
			Shield at Wembley, but was then hampered by injury set-backs, limiting him to 16 appearances. <br>
			<br>
			It was particularly frustrating given that the Ghana international had established himself as the <br>
			midfield lynchpin in the team in 2022/23. Strong in the tackle and a tireless runner, Thomas joined <br>
			the from Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in October 2020, having featured in the 2016 Champions League <br>
			final and lifted the Europa League and European Super Cup. <br>
			<br>
			He would also pick up a La Liga winner’s medal for his contribution in 2020/21. Ghana’s Player of the <br>
			Year in both 2018 and 2019, he is now vice-captain of the national side, twice featuring at the Africa <br>
			Cup of Nations and appearing in every one of their matches at the 2022 World Cup.<br>
