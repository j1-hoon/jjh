			Powerful Poland international defender Jakub proved his worth last term, making 30 appearances – <br>
			18 of them starts – and starring at left back during eight successive starts through February and <br>
			March 2024 that included six Premier League victories and a battling 0-0 draw at Manchester City. <br>
			<br>
			He also contributed one goal, in the 4-1 win over Newcastle United in February, and three assists. <br>
			The athletic and versatile defender, who can also play centre back and often features on the left <br>
			of a back three for his country, signed in January 2023 from Italian side Spezia, having played a <br>
			leading role for Poland at the World Cup the previous month. <br>
			<br>
			He featured eight times in the second half of 2022/23, scoring his first goal in the final-day 5-0 <br>
			win over Wolves. <br>
			<br>
			Jakub spent his youth career at Polish club GKS Tychy and in Belgium with Anderlecht before moving <br>
			to Slovakian side FK Zeleziarne Podbrezova as an 18-year-old. From MSK Zilina he joined Spezia in <br>
			August 2021, and made his international debut the following June. <br>
			<br>
			He played every minute of Poland’s World Cup campaign, which took them to the last 16 for the first <br>
			time in 36 years. He was again on international duty last summer as the country reached the knockout <br>
			stages of Euro 2024 in Germany.
