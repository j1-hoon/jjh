			Electric forward Gabriel once again terrorised defenders across the country with his pace, trickery <br>
			and ability to cut inside from his starting position on the left wing. He contributed 10 goal <br>
			involvements in the Premier League last term, weighing in with some important strikes, notably the <br>
			winner against Manchester City at Emirates Stadium in October and the crucial second goal in our 3-1<br>
			home win over Liverpool in February. <br>
			<br>
			Our joint-top scorer in 2022/23, he signed a new long-term contract in February of that season – and <br>
			matched Roberto Firmino’s record total of goals by a Brazilian in a single Premier League campaign. <br>
			<br>
			Gabi (full name Gabriel Teodoro Martinelli Silva) arrived in north London from Brazilian side Ituano <br>
			in July 2019, scoring ten times and winning the Arsenal Goal of the Season award for a stunning solo <br>
			effort in a 2-2 draw at Chelsea during his debut season. <br>
			<br>
			The former Brazil youth international made his senior debut in 2022, featured at the 2022 World Cup as <br>
			the Selecao reached the quarter-finals and netted his first two international goals last season. He was <br>
			part of the Brazil squad at the 2024 Copa America in USA.<br>
