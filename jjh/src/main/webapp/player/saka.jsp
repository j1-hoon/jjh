			Our young winger enjoyed another stellar season, finishing as our top scorer in both the Premier <br>
			League (16) and all competitions (20) with career-best totals. He also contributed nine assists in <br>
			the league and four in the Champions League to go with his four goals in Europe, captained the club <br>
			for the first time in a 5-0 home win over Sheffield United and celebrated his 200th appearance the <br>
			following month – the fourth-youngest player to reach that milestone for us. <br>
			<br>
			The leading goalscorer, assister and appearance-maker in the current squad, he joined the club’s Hale <br>
			End Academy at the age of eight and rose through the system before making his first-team debut at the <br>
			age of 17. <br>
			<br>
			He was named Arsenal Player of the Year in both 2021 and 2022, and won our Goal of the Season award <br>
			last term for his strike against Nottingham Forest on the opening weekend. <br>
			<br>
			A senior international since October 2020, he played in his second major tournament in 2022, scoring <br>
			three goals at the Qatar World Cup as England reached the quarter-final. He represented his country <br>
			again at Euro 2024, becoming Arsenal’s all-time leading scorer for the England national team when he <br>
			netted against Switzerland in the quarter-final.<br>
