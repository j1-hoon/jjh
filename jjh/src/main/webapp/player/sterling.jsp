			Experienced and versatile England forward Raheem became our final addition of the summer when <br>
			he joined on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea on transfer deadline day. <br>
			<br>
			The flying winger, who is known for his quick feet, dribbling ability and knack for scoring <br>
			important goals, can play anywhere across the front line and also featured as a striker for <br>
			Manchester City, where he formed a strong relationship with Mikel Arteta. <br>
			<br>
			Raheem began his youth career at QPR before making a high-profile move to Liverpool’s academy in <br>
			2010. He made his senior debut in 2012 and earned his first England cap the same year, at the age <br>
			of just 17. <br>
			<br>
			He then moved to Manchester City in 2015, winning four Premier League titles, five League Cups, <br>
			the FA Cup and Community Shield before joining Chelsea in 2022. <br>
			<br>
			Raheem’s individual honours include being named FWA Footballer of the Year in 2018/19 and being <br>
			voted into the PFA’s Team of the Year in the same season. <br>
			<br>
			With 82 England caps on his arrival – only 16 players have made more appearances for the men’s <br>
			team – he has featured at each of the last three World Cups and was a key player for his country <br>
			as they finished runners-up at Euro 2020.<br>
