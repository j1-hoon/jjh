			Our record signing in the summer of 2023, England international Declan was <br>

			He contributed seven goals and eight assists in the Premier League, and some of those goals were <br>
			crucial – his first strike for the club was the late second goal in the 3-1 home win over <br>
			Manchester United in September 2023, and he also helped earn a 2-2 draw at Chelsea and netted the <br>
			96th minute winner in our 4-3 victory at Luton Town. <br>
			<br>
			He finished second in our Player of the Season vote, after being named as our Player of the Month <br>
			for August 2023. <br>

			The all-action midfielder signed from West Ham United, where he made 245 appearances, scoring 15 <br>
			goals, wore the captain’s armband in his final season and lifted the Europa Conference League <br>
			trophy, having made his debut for the club at the age of 18 in August 2017. <br>
			<br>
			An England international since 2019, Declan featured in every Three Lions game during their run to <br>
			the Euro 2020 final and the 2022 World Cup quarter-finals, and was again ever-present at Euro 2024. <br>
			<br>
			Before representing England – for whom he captained the side on the occasion of his 50th cap last <br>
			season – he played three times for the senior Republic of Ireland national team.<br>
