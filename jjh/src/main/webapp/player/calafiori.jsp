			Classy defender Riccardo joined us before the start of the season, after starring for Italy at Euro <br>
			2024. <br>
			<br>
			An imposing, intelligent left-footed defender who can play in the centre of the back line or at left <br>
			back, Riccardo made his full debut for Italy in June 2024, then started all three group games at the <br>
			Euros. <br>
			<br>
			At 22 years and 27 days, he became the second youngest Italian, after Paolo Maldini, to play at the <br>
			European Championships, and contributed an assist in the 1-1 draw with Croatia. <br>
			<br>
			Last season, he impressed with Bologna, being named Serie A Player of the Month for May, and helping <br>
			his side qualify for the Champions League. <br>
			<br>
			Before that, he spent one season with Swiss Super League side FC Basel, who he joined from boyhood club <br>
			Roma. He made his debut for Roma as an 18 year old in 2020, having recovered from a serious knee injury <br>
			in his youth days. After 18 first-team appearances for Roma, he had a brief loan spell with Genoa before <br>
			moving to Switzerland. <br>
			<br>
			An attack-minded, composed defender, he has been a youth international since the under-15 age group, and <br>
			also represented his country at under-16, -17, -19 and -21 levels before progressing to full honours.<br>
