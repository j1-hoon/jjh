			Livewire forward Gabriel Jesus continued to menace opposition defenders last term, despite <br>
			undergoing knee surgery four days before the Community Shield. He contributed eight goals and <br>
			eight assists, and was particularly effective in the Champions League, producing Playerof the <br>
			Match displays in the 2-1 win at Sevilla and 6-0 thrashing of RC Lens. He also extended his <br>
			incredible record of never being on the losing side when scoring in a Premier League match <br>
			(the tally stood at 60 matches – 55 wins and 5 draws – at the start of this season). <br>
			<br>
			A willing runner with excellent close control, Gabriel offers more than just goals thanks to his <br>
			willingness to link up play, and he has a wealth of Premier League experience – the Brazilian <br>
			joined in July 2022 having previously been coached by Mikel Arteta at Manchester City, where he <br>
			won four Premier League titles, as well as one FA Cup and three League Cups, and scored 95 goals. <br>
			<br>
			A teenage sensation at Palmeiras, the pacey forward made his first-team debut as a 17 year old <br>
			and burst onto the international scene by winning gold with the under-23s at the Rio Olympics in <br>
			2016. Later that year he made his debut for the senior team, then featured at the 2018 and 2022 <br>
			World Cups – although a knee injury in their final group game ruled him out until March 2023.<br>
