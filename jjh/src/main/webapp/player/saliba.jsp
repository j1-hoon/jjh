			Despite being young in his early 20s, he is considered the core of Arsenal's <br>

			Dominant defender William continued to establish himself as one of the best centre backs in Europe <br>
			during his second season in our first team. <br>
			<br>
			The elegant, pacey defender became the first Arsenal outfield player since Lee Dixon in 1989/90 to <br>
			play every minute of the league season, and he was a cornerstone of the Premier League’s meanest <br>
			defence, winning possession 213 times; more than any other central defender in the division. <br>
			<br>
			William made his long-awaited debut in 2022/23 after initially signing in July 2019 and impressed from <br>
			the start, underpinning our title challenge until suffering a season-ending back injury in March 2023. <br>
			<br>
			He had originally made his breakthrough at Saint-Etienne, where he remained on loan after signing for <br>
			us, and reached the French Cup final before spending half of 2020/21 on loan at Nice. He joined <br>
			Marseille on loan the following season and helped the club to a second-place finish during a campaign <br>
			in which he was named the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year, earned a spot in the league’s Team of the <br>
			Year and made his senior international debut. <br>
			<br>
			He featured for France at the 2022 World Cup and was on the pitch for every minute of his country’s <br>
			Euro 2024 campaign, being named in the UEFATeam of the Tournament as France reached the semi-final.<br>
