			Marauding left back Oleksandr continued to bring authority to the back line and pose a threat going <br>
			forward during his second season in north London, featuring 35 times despite being ruled out for a <br>
			month with a calf injury in February 2024. <br>
			<br>
			Often inverting into a midfield role from his starting position at the back, he provided two assists <br>
			in the Premier League and his exquisite half-volley in a 3-1 win over Burnley won our Goal of the Month <br>
			award for November 2023. <br>
			<br>
			But perhaps more important was his contribution to the best defence in the league, having settled in <br>
			quickly during his first season in north London. <br>
			<br>
			The Ukraine international joined in the summer of 2023 from Manchester City, where his versatility was <br>
			well known to his former coach Mikel Arteta and where he won nine major trophies, including four Premier <br>
			League titles, in six seasons. <br>
			<br>
			Alex, as he is known around the club, became Ukraineâ€™s youngest goalscorer at the age of 19 and their <br>
			youngest captain, aged 24, against France in March 2021. <br>
			<br>
			The hard-running yet tactically minded defender, who is also comfortable in various midfield roles, was <br>
			also named Ukraine Footballer of the Year in 2019 and has represented his country at three European <br>
			Championships, most recently Euro 2024.<br>
