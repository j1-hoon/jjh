			The Brazilian, who featured in all but two Premier League fixtures, also contributed four goals, <br>
			notably in the 1-1 draw at Liverpool in December, then a double in the 5-0 home win over Crystal <br>
			Palace in January. He was duly named as our Player of the Month shortly afterwards. <br>
			<br>
			Now in his fifth season in north London, he arrived from French club Lille in September 2020, s<br>
			coring on his debut – a 3-0 win over Fulham – and immediately established himself as a key figure <br>
			in the defence. Up to the start of this season, he had scored more Premier League goals than any <br>
			other defender since his debut. <br>
			<br>
			Gabriel (full name Gabriel dos Santos Magalhaes) started his career with Avai in Santa Catarina, <br>
			Brazil, before moving to France, and he also had loan spells with Troyes and Croatian giants Dinamo <br>
			Zagreb, where he won a league and cup double in 2017/18. <br>
			<br>
			He played for his country at the 2017 South American Under-20 Championships and made his senior <br>
			international debut last season, scoring against Venezuela in October 2023. He was part of Brazil’s <br>
			squad at the 2024 Copa America in the USA.<br>
