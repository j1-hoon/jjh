			Imposing defender Takehiro made a valuable contribution at both ends of the pitch in 2023/24, <br>
			providing power and aerial ability in both full back positions and weighing in with two goals, <br>
			an assist and a hand in the goal that sealed victory over Manchester City in October 2023. <br>
			<br>
			Powerful and consistent, the Japan international ended the season approaching a century of <br>
			Gunners appearances. <br>
			<br>
			‘Tomi’, as he is known around the club, joined the Gunners in August 2021 from Serie A side Bologna <br>
			and immediately settled in at right back, winning our September Player of the Month award, an accolade <br>
			he collected again in October 2023. <br>
			<br>
			Having begun his career at J1 League outfit Avispa Fukuoka, he moved to Belgian side Sint-Truiden in <br>
			2018 and won the club’s Player of the Season award before moving to Italy. <br>
			<br>
			A senior international since 2018 and a regular at centre back, he represented his country on home soil <br>
			at the 2020 Olympics but fitness issues meant he largely featured from the bench at the 2022 World Cup <br>
			before starting their 1-1 draw with Croatia – which ended in defeat on penalties – in the Round of 16. <br>
			He helped his country reach the quarter-final of the AFC Asian Cup in February 2024.<br>
