			Experienced Brazilian goalkeeper Neto reinforced our depth between the posts when he joined on <br>
			a season-long loan from Bournemouth on the final day of the transfer window. <br>
			<br>
			The shot stopper, whose career spans 15 years in his homeland and Europe, made 63 appearances <br>
			for the south coast club and was named captain just six months after joining from Barcelona in <br>
			August 2022.
			<br>
			Having come through the youth ranks at Brazilian giants Cruzeiro, he made his senior debut for <br>
			Athletico Paranaense in August 2009 and quickly established himself in the first team, before <br>
			moving to Europe by joining Fiorentina in Serie A in 2011. 
			<br>
			The keeper (full name Norberto Murara Neto) featured 101 times and impressed sufficiently to earn <br>
			a move to Juventus, where, although he was largely back-up to the great Gianluigi Buffon, he won <br>
			two Serie A titles, two Coppa Italias and one Supercoppa.<br>
			
			His next destination was Spain, where he lifted the Copa del Rey with Valencia in 2019 before <br>
			joining Barcelona, where he enjoyed another cup success in 2021. 
			<br>
			Neto was first called into the Brazil squad in 2010, and finally made his debut eight years later <br>
			in a 5-0 friendly win over El Salvador.
