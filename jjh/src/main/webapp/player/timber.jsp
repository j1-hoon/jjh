			Having lifted the Community Shield on his debut, the Netherlands international suffered an ACL <br>
			injury on the opening day of the Premier League season and, having worked tirelessly on his <br>
			recovery, finally made his third appearance from the bench on the final day – although he did <br>
			also have the Arsenal Goal of the Month award for April as compensation after he netted a sumptuous <br>
			curling effort for the under-21s at Blackburn Rovers in his comeback game. <br>
			<br>
			The skilful defender joined in the summer of 2023 after establishing himself for both Ajax and the <br>
			Netherlands national team, and he is famed for his versatility – he can play anywhere in defence and <br>
			even midfield – and superb passing range. His handful of appearances for us last season came at left <br>
			back, from where he looked to maraud forward. <br>
			<br>
			He made his first-team debut for Ajax at the age of 18 in 2020 and went on to win two league titles, <br>
			as well as the Eredivisie Player and Talent of the Year awards in 2021/22. <br>
			<br>
			A senior international since June 2021, he featured four times for his country at the 2022 World Cup.<br>
			His twin brother Quinten is also a full Netherlands international and another brother, Dylan, plays <br>
			in the Netherlands and represents Curacao (their father’s nationality).<br>
