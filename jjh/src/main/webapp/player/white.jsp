			The 2023/24 season was another of huge progress for gifted defender Ben, who scored a personal <br>
			best four goals – all in the Premier League – and contributed five assists to complement his <br>
			outstanding defensive performances at right back. <br>
			<br>
			His ability at both ends of the pitch – contributing to the best defence and lowest expected <br>
			goals against figure (28.4) in the league while linking up effectively with top scorer Bukayo <br>
			Saka – was rewarded with our Player of the Month award in March, when he scored at Sheffield <br>
			United, chipped in with two assists and helped us to three clean sheets. That goal at Bramall <br>
			Lane was also the 10,000th in the club’s history, in all competitions. <br>
			<br>
			This was Ben’s second season at right back after spending his first campaign in 2021/22 in the <br>
			centre of defence having signed from Brighton & Hove Albion in July 2021. He came through the <br>
			Seagulls’ academy and made his debut at the age of 18 before enjoying loan spells at Newport <br>
			County in League Two, Peterborough United in League One and Leeds United, where he won their Young <br>
			Player of the Year award en route to the Championship title in 2019/20. <br>
			<br>
			He returned to Brighton the following season, winning their Player of the Year award, before moving<br>
			to north London.<br>
