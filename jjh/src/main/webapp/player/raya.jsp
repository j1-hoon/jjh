			The Barcelona-born stopper was also nominated for the Premier League Save of the Month for<br> 
			his stunning reaction save to deny Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson in September 2023, and alongside a<br>
			further four clean sheets in the Champions League, he saved two penalties in the shootout to help<br>
			us past Porto in the Round of 16. 
			<br>
			The experienced keeper, who is renowned for his catching ability when coming for crosses,<br> 
			calmness under pressure and precise passing, arrived in England in 2012, at the age of 16, when he<br> 
			joined Blackburn Rovers’ academy.<br> 
			<br>
			He played on loan at Southport in the National League before helping Rovers to promotion from<br> 
			League One in 2018. A year later he joined Brentford, winning the Championship Golden Glove<br> 
			award in 2019/20, and was a key player as the Bees won promotion to the Premier League in 2021.<br> 
			<br>
			He won his first cap for Spain in March 2022 and was a member of the 2022 World Cup squad,<br> 
			before playing one group game – keeping a clean sheet – as Spain triumphed at Euro 2024. He<br>
			joined us permanently shortly before the start of this season.<br>
