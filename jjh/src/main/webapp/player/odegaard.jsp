			Gifted playmaker Martin captained the side with distinction last season and once again led by <br>
			example, whether by pressing from the front, tracking back to regain possession or leading the <br>
			forward charge. His goal involvements alone – eight goals and ten assists in the Premier League – <br>
			don’t tell the whole story, as only two players in the league created more than his 102 chances <br>
			and no player won possession in the final third more often than his 41. <br>
			<br>
			He was also influential in the Champions League, winning two Man of the Match awards, and he was <br>
			named our Player of the Season for the second consecutive campaign, having contributed 15 league <br>
			goals and seven assists in 2022/23, his first as captain. <br>
			<br>
			The hugely talented and quietly authoritative midfielder initially joined the club on loan from Real <br>
			Madrid in January 2021 before making the move permanent that summer. He made his senior debut for <br>
			Stromgodsetaged 15, then signed for Madrid shortly afterwards and became their youngest player aged 16 <br>
			years and 157 days. <br>
			<br>
			He has been a full international since August 2014, when he became Norway’s youngest ever player, aged <br>
			15 years and 253 days, and he has captained his country since March 2021.<br>
